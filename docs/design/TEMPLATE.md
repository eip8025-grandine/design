# <NNNN> — <Imperative phrase: "Verify execution proofs before attesting">

## Context
What we're building and why, plus the Grandine and spec context you
need to know to read the rest. Link rather than re-explain. Note here
anything in the spec baseline that is still provisional upstream and
what breaks for us if it moves.

## Goals and non-goals
**Goals** — include numbers where the design turns on them (latency
budgets, memory bounds, proof counts).
- ...

**Non-goals** — things that could reasonably have been goals and are
deliberately excluded.
- ...

## Design
Overview, then detail. Include a diagram when the change crosses
component boundaries. Describe the interfaces and the retained state;
skip pseudo-code and link prototypes instead.

## Trade-offs and alternatives
What this design costs us, and which alternatives were rejected, with
the deciding trade-off. Be brief, but don't omit the one the reviewer
is going to ask about.

## Security and compatibility
Required. Adversarial model, DoS and resource-exhaustion surface, what
an invalid or withheld proof can cause, and behavior for nodes that
don't opt in.

## Implementation and testing
How this lands as a reviewable PR series against
`grandinetech/grandine`, which parts stand alone without EIP-8025, and
how it gets tested (unit, spec conformance, devnet).

## Open questions
What must be settled before this moves to Accepted, and what is
deliberately deferred.
